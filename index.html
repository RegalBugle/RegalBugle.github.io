    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Thanks for checking us out. We are currently rebuilding the project to feature a rating system rather than a voting system. We believe this will help people evaluate articles without having to consider the overall content of the forum </p>
    <hr>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to create a media space that is democratically run and shared by the limited audience of anyone and everyone in the room. It combines the democratic technology of Reddit with a personal touch, the knowledge that the only people that are involved are people you know are real and have face to face dynamic with. </p>

    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16CB1gz5uRKWjXSIOiIWagmnshKi1W1qKjjg8ZQMiTEM/edit?usp=sharing"> Here is a comprehensive document which explains what it is and why we believe the concept is optimal. </a>
    <p>This and other questions or suggestions can be sent via email to regalbugle25@gmail.com</p>
