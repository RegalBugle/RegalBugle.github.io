    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Thanks for checking us out. Currently the app functionality is down. I'm not sure I want to print a paper anyway, it was never an important part of the concept. The plan is to make some time to post myself at the entrance and sign people on as a social experiment.</p>
    <p>One thing I'm conflicted on is whether I should actually limit access strictly to the room. I believe expressing the sentiment alongside monitoring the growth of the userbase alongside the people that choose to participate is a satisfying enough solution, but I've heard the opinion that without truely limiting access, the point of the process wont stand out as it should. If you have an opinion about this, I would like to hear it. </p>
    <p>This and other questions or suggestions can be sent via email to regalbugle25@gmail.com</p>
