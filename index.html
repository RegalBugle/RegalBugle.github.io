    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Thanks for checking us out. Currently the app functionality is down. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to create a media space that is democratically run and shared by the limited audience of anyone and everyone in the room. It combines the democratic technology of Reddit with a personal touch, the knowledge that the only people that are involved are people you know are real and have face to face dynamic with. </p>
    <p>One thing I'm conflicted on is whether I should actually limit access strictly to the room. I believe expressing the sentiment alongside monitoring the growth of the userbase alongside the people that choose to participate is a satisfying enough solution, but I've heard the opinion that without truely limiting access, the point of the process wont stand out as it should. If you have an opinion about this, I would like to hear it. </p>
    <p>In my minds eye, I see the result as more of a bulliton board than a news feed, in that information is more or less consistant over time. This, to me, seems like a great antidote to the fast paced news cycle and firehosing.</p>
